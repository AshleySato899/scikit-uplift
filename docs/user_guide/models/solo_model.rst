Approaches with the same model

One model with treatment as feature
========================================

The simplest and most intuitive solution: the model is trained on union of two groups, with the binary
communication flag acting as an additional feature. Each object from the test sample is scored twice:
with the communication flag equal to `1` and equal to `0`. Subtracting the probabilities for each observation,
we get the required uplift.

    In sklift this approach corresponds to the  :class:`.SoloModel` class and the **dummy** method.

Treatment interaction
=========================

The approach described above has various modifications. For example, double the number of attributes by adding
the product of each attribute to the interaction flag:
